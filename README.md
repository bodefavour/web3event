# web3event

Mobile-first Expo + React Native + TypeScript starter.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```
3. Launch on a device or emulator:
   - Press `a` for Android emulator
   - Press `i` for iOS simulator (macOS only)
   - Press `w` for web preview

## Project Structure

- `App.tsx` — Entry point with theme-aware scaffolding ready for Figma-driven screens.
- `src/theme` — Palette tokens to map design system colors.
- `src/components` — Themed primitives.
- `src/hooks` — Shared hooks including palette selection.

## Next Steps

- Replace placeholder palette tokens with values from your Figma design system.
- Add navigation (e.g., Expo Router or React Navigation) when flows are defined.
- Wire up design assets (icons, illustrations) under `assets/`.
